    <p>The average cost for an <span class="ice_c">EV</span> is <span class="ice_c">$56,437</span>. This high upfront cost makes it unaffordable for many car buyers. The cost can be lowered by federal and state tax credits, but it still works out to higher than a comparable <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicle.</span></p>

    <p>Currently in the US, it will take driving an <span class="ice_c">EV</span> about <span class="ice_c">15,000 miles</span>, about a year of driving, to become cleaner than an equivalent <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicle</span> in terms of its lifetime carbon footprint.</p>

    <p>On average, an <span class="ice_c">EV</span> will cost about <span class="ice_c">$47</span> per month (@ 19.5 Â¢/kWh) to recharge at home in MA. Comparatively, the average cost to refuel per month for a <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicle</span> is <span class="ice_i">$103</span> (based on a commute of 30 miles/day @ 25MPG with gas at $4.30/gallon).</p>

    <p>Due to increased litigation surrounding vehicle emissions and a societal trend towards cleaner power sources, more and more vehicle manufacturers are starting to shut down their <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicle</span> production lines in favor of producing <span class="ice_c">EVs</span>.</p>

    <p>Factoring in average fuel cost per mile for an <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicle</span> and comparing it the the average electricity cost per mile for an <span class="ice_c">EV</span>, the break-even point for an <span class="ice_c">EV</span> in fuel costs alone is at 300,000 miles. While this may seem high, <span class="ice_c">EVs</span> don't have nearly as many moving parts as <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicles</span> and don't require much maintenance throughout their lifespans, so they will last much longer than the typical <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicle</span> does.</p>

    <p>Currently, the biggest challenges for <span class="ice_e">H<sub>2</sub> vehicle</span> manufacturers and proponents to overcome is the lack of infrastructure, the cost to store and transport hydrogen, and the cost of producing the gas.</p>

    <p>New <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicles</span> sold in the US will need to average at least <span class="ice_i">40 miles per gallon</span> by 2026 as required by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This effort will reduce gasoline consumption by more than 220 billion gallons over the life of vehicles as compared to the Trump administration's policies.</p>

    <p>There are currently three levels of <span class="ice_c">EV</span> chargers.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Level 1 chargers use standard household 120 volt AC electricity to charge, thus require no extra equipment to use and can plug directly into a wall outlet. Level 1 charging is the slowest of the three levels and provides about 2 to 5 miles of range per 1 hour of charging. </li>
      <li>Level 2 chargers use the same type of connection as Level 1 chargers (J1772 connectors), but are powered by 208/240 volt AC, so these chargers require the installation of home charging equipment. Most <span class="ice_c">EV</span> owners will opt to install Level 2 chargers at their homes to charge their vehicles overnight, and these chargers provide 10 to 20 miles of range per 1 hour of charging. </li>
      <li>Level 3 chargers, also referred to as DC Fast Chargers because they use direct current (DC) as opposed to alternating current (AC) as used by the first two levels, use 480 volt electricity and come in three different connector types: CCS, CHAdeMO, and Tesla. Level 3 chargers provide 60 to 80 miles of range per 20 minutes of charging. Level 3 chargers are not suitable for home installation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to note that not every <span class="ice_c">EV</span> supports all three levels of charging, and even then, currently no <span class="ice_c">EVs</span> can support the full amount of power Level 3 chargers can output. And of course, not all <span class="ice_c">EVs</span> use the same type of connector, but currently the CHAdeMO connector is the most popular for non-Tesla <span class="ice_c">EVs</span>.</p>

    <p><span class="ice_c">EVs</span> still lack the large scale infrastructure and compatability needed for mass adoption. Charging stations are not nearly as close by as gas stations are, not all of stations are made to the same standards, and they're not required to support every type of connector. This can cause large variations in vehicle recharge times as well as limit where you can go, both to recharge or to just travel.</p>

    <p>A study by AAA found that the effective range for an <span class="ice_c">EV</span> is dramatically reduced in extreme temperatures when using heating or air conditioning. On average, when driving at 20 degrees with the heat off, the range drops by 12%, but with the heat on, it falls to 41% of the usual range. Similarly, but not as severe a drop, in 95 degree weather, battery range can fall by 4% with the AC off, and 17% with AC on.</p>

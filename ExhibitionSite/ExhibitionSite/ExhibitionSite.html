    <p>The average cost for an <span class="ice_c">EV</span> is <span class="ice_c">$56,437</span>. This high upfront cost makes it unaffordable for most current car buyers.</p>

    <p>Currently in the US, it will take driving an <span class="ice_c">EV</span> about <span class="ice_c">15,000 miles</span>, about a year of driving, to become cleaner than an equivalent gasoline car in terms of its lifetime carbon footprint.</p>

    <p>On average, an <span class="ice_c">EV</span> will cost about <span class="ice_c">$47</span> per month (@ 19.5 Â¢/kWh) to recharge at home in MA. Comparatively, the average cost to refuel per month for a <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicle</span> is <span class="ice_i">$103</span> (based on a commute of 30 miles/day @ 25MPG with gas at $4.30/gallon).</p>

    <p>Due to increased litigation surrounding vehicle emissions and a societal trend towards cleaner power sources, more and more vehicle manufacturers are starting to shut down their <span class="ice_i">ICE vehcile</span> production lines in favor of producing <span class="ice_c">EVs</span>.</p>

    <p>Factoring in average fuel cost per mile for an <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicle</span> and comparing it the the average electricity cost per mile for an <span class="ice_c">EV</span>, the break-even point for an <span class="ice_c">EV</span> in fuel costs alone is at 300,000 miles. While this may seem high, <span class="ice_c">EVs</span> don't have nearly as many moving parts as <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicles</span> and don't require much maintenance throughout their lifespans, so they will last much longer than the typical <span class="ice_i">ICE vehicle</span> does.</p>

    <p>Currently, the biggest challenges for <span class="ice_e">H<sub>2</sub> vehicle</span> manufacturers and proponents to overcome is the lack of infastructure, the cost to store and transport it, and the cost of producing it.</p>
